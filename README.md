# aws-signature-version-4
Signature Version 4 is the process to add authentication information to AWS requests sent by HTTP. 
<br/>
For security, most requests to AWS must be signed with an access key, which consists of an access key ID and secret access key. These two keys are commonly referred to as your security credentials.
</br>
When you manually create HTTP requests to access AWS services, you must sign requests that require signing yourself.
